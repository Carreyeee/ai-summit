# AI Application Summit 2026 Sydney — Website

The official landing page for the **AI Application Summit 2026 Sydney**, hosted by
**Australian Financial News (AFN)**.

- **Date:** 14 August 2026
- **Venue:** ICC Sydney
- **Theme:** Empowering Business Growth Through AI Applications
- **Live site:** https://aisummit-weld.vercel.app
- **Tickets:** [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/2026-tickets-1990168493538) · Luma (coming soon)

It's a **single static landing page** — no build step, no framework. Just HTML, CSS
and one JS file. Anyone can clone it and edit it with a text editor.

## Quick start (local preview)

## How to update the common things

Everything below is a quick find-and-edit. Search for the text in the file shown.

| What | File | How |
|------|------|-----|
| **Date / venue / theme** | `site/index.html` | Edit the hero + "At a glance" + footer text. Also update the countdown date in `site/js/main.js` (`initCountdown`) and the `startDate` in the JSON-LD block in `index.html`. |
| **Agenda** | `site/index.html` | Edit the `#agenda` section (Morning / Afternoon / Evening blocks). |
| **Speakers** (indicative) | `site/js/main.js` | Edit the `SPEAKERS` array near the top — name, role, org (EN + ZH). Cards render automatically. |
| **Eventbrite link** | `site/js/main.js` | `CONFIG.eventbriteUrl`. |
| **Luma link** | `site/js/main.js` | `CONFIG.lumaUrl` — paste the URL and the "coming soon" button goes live automatically. |
| **Ticket prices** | `site/index.html` | Edit the `data-early` / `data-standard` values in the `#tickets` cards. |
| **Contact details** | `site/index.html` | Edit the `#contact` section. |
| **SEO keywords** | `site/index.html` | Edit `<meta name="keywords">` and the description/OG tags in `<head>`. |

### Bilingual text (English / 中文)

English is written directly in `index.html`. The Chinese translation lives in the
`ZH` dictionary in `site/js/main.js`, keyed by the `data-i18n="..."` attribute on each
element. To change a piece of Chinese text, find its key in `ZH` and edit the value.
If a key is missing from `ZH`, the site simply falls back to English — safe by default.

## Deploy

The site auto-serves from the `site/` folder on Vercel.

```bash
cd site
npx vercel --prod --yes
```

3. Commit and push: `git push -u origin your-change`

Small content fixes (a date, a name, a price) can go straight to `main` if you have
access — keep commits focused and described.
